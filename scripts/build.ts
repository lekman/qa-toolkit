/**
 * Build a package's CLI with Bun, targeting Node.
 *
 * Shared by every workspace package: `bun run build` inside a package runs
 * this script with the package directory as the working directory.
 *
 * Prompt libraries are bundled into the output rather than declared as runtime
 * dependencies. The published package therefore installs nothing, so a cold
 * `npx @lekman/<package>` starts in about a second and works on any machine
 * with Node 20 — Bun is a build-time tool here, not a requirement for users.
