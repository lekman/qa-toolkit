# Fail if client-identifying content reaches this public repository.
#
# The repo is published. Client names, their repository names, ticket keys and
# meeting titles must never appear in it — examples use placeholders (Acme,
# Globex, PROJ-nnn). See plugins/obsidian/README.md for the three tiers.
#
# Terms live in scripts/client-terms.txt, one extended-regex per line, so the
# list can be updated without touching this script. That file is gitignored:
# it would otherwise be the leak it exists to prevent. Start from
# scripts/client-terms.example.txt. No list means no check — a contributor who
# works with no clients is never blocked.
#
# Modes:
#   (none)      tracked + untracked-but-not-ignored files in the working tree
#   --staged    the staged blobs only, as the pre-commit hook runs it
#   --history   every blob in every reachable commit
#   --message <file>  one commit message, as the commit-msg hook runs it
#   --messages [range]  every commit message in a range (default: all)
#   --quiet     report locations only — never the matched text
#
# Commit messages need the same rule as file content, and are worse to get
# wrong. They travel further — pull request titles, notifications, release
# notes, a `git log` pasted into an issue — and a changelog generator turns
# them into a shipped artefact. They are also the one thing a later cleanup
# cannot fix quietly: redacting a file is a commit, redacting a message is a
# history rewrite.
#
# --quiet exists for CI. A failure report that quotes the match puts the very
# string this check protects into a build log, which is public for a public
# repo. Locally the full context is printed, because the machine running it
# already holds the term list.
#
# --staged reads staged *content*, not the file on disk. A partially staged
# file can differ from its working copy, and the commit records the staged one.
#
# --history is the check that catches a leak already committed. The working
# tree going clean does not clean the history behind it: a fix commit corrects
# the tip and leaves the earlier blob exactly where it was, published. Stale
# local branches count as reachable, so prune before reading its output as a
# statement about what is published.
