## Testing Evidence

<!--
One row per evidence base in scope.
Status legend: 🟢 passed · 🟡 deferred · ⚪ out of scope / manual testing required.
A skill or prompt change is tested by running it and showing what it did.
"The wording is clearer" is not evidence.

| What to test         | How (evidence base) | Surface   | Status | Evidence                     |

| _behaviour under_    | Unit                | packages/ | 🟢     | `bun test` pass              |

<!--
This repo's client is not under a regulatory standard, so the default
template's "Regulatory impact" section is deliberately absent. See
plugins/git/skills/pr/SKILL.md step 1b for when it applies.

## Intended Use Verification

<!--
Delete for trivial changes. Add when step-by-step manual verification helps a
reviewer confirm the change does what it intends: prerequisites, the exact
steps, and the expected observation at each step.
-->

## Validations Passed
